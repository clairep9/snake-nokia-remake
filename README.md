- **Smooth Controls**: Intuitive keyboard controls for responsive gameplay.
- **AI Competitor (Optional)**: Toggle on an AI-controlled snake that competes for food using advanced pathfinding algorithms and decision-making logic.
- **Game Modes**: Play solo or compete against the AI for a more challenging experience.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your best scores to challenge yourself or others.
